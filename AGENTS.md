# Nux
This is an unusual and non-trivial project. If you don't understand something ask the user, he is the original author.

### Nux CLI
The nux CLI entry point is `src/nux-cli/main.js` and is, in addition to writing their own nux code, the main way users interact with nux.

### General Instructions
- Use tabs instead of spaces for indentation
- Omit end-of-line semicolons in js/jsx/ts/tsx

### Git commits
Never commit without being explicitly asked to. When making a commit, always add "Co-Authored-By AI" as the last line of the commit message. Before making a commit check if the commit fixed a bug or implemented a feature listed in Issues.md (and if so remove it as part of the commit). Don't include trivial details. All commit messages should with a type such "feat" or "fix".

### Commands
When the user says "generate-docs-123" read docs/AGENTS.md and follow the instructions.
